Introduction
------------

Thank you for taking a look at my game!

This is a recreation of the original Pokemon games in text format via the Windows console. I aim to make it as true to the original games as possible, while removing some of the unnecessarily complicated and/or frustrating stuff.

There's not a whole lot of content in just yet but I aim to slowly add more stuff. :-)


Change log
----------

v0.3 - September 2014

- I have cleaned up a big part of the code and fixed various small bugs. 

- All of the 151 original Pokemon are now in the game! Many new moves have been added to go with them, roughly supporting up to level 20.

- Pokemon can now evolve, just like in the original games. Pokemon that normally evolve via trading will instead evolve at a set level.

- The introduction has been updated. You can now select a name for yourself and the rival, and there is also a helpful introduction on how to catch wild Pokemon and heal your own.
 
- Selecting a move now works by inputting a number rather than typing the move's name. No more typos!

- All of the Pokemon in your party that participate in a battle will receive experience, rather than just the active one.

- Wild Pokemon have been beefed up a bit so that they're no longer free EXP punching bags. :( This also caused them to yield slightly more experience as well!


---------------------------

v0.2 - January 2014

- The story has been extended up to Pewter City, where you can fight Brock. There are now 16 Pokemon in the game, as well as several new moves to go with them.

- The attack & defense stats have been separated into physical and special attack & defense. Physical and special attacks target physical and special defense respectively. 

- Moves now also have secondary effects (such as burn, poison, -attack, and so on) as well as accuracy & priority factors.

- You can now save the game! In the overworld menu, simply type "save". Then, next time you want to continue playing from that point, type "load" in the first screen of the game.

- Items have been added. Currently only PokeBalls and Potions are available. You can buy those at a mart by typing "mart" while inside a city.

- You can now catch Pokemon! During a fight with a wild Pokemon, type "catch" to experience the magic. The same rules as the original Pokemon games apply - lower HP = higher chance to catch.

- In addition to the previous, you can now switch your Pokemon around, which includes changing your active Pokemon in combat. The command for this is "switch".

- A box to store your Pokemon has also been added. When your party is full (6 Pokemon), new Pokemon you catch will automatically go to the box. The box can hold up to 30 Pokemon.

- Multiple secrets have been added to the game. Can you find them all? ;-)

---------------------------

v0.1.1 - January 2014

- Fixed a bug where 2 Pokemon having the same speed would cause the game to come to a halt.
- Added "center" command for cities, as designated on the help menu.

---------------------------

v0.1 - January 2014

- First public beta release!
- The game currently supports 7 Pokemon and exploring all the way up to Viridian City.
- Currently you can only battle against the rival and wild Pidgeys and Rattatas in Route 1.
- Also, to those more keen on... exploring their options, this version features a fun little secret!
